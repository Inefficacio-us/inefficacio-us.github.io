<p>Bonnaroo was cancelled this year. Thirty-six hours before I planned to leave, 36 hours
after I made final travel arrangements.</p>

<p>None of the rest of the planning matters. Ultimately, I landed on a different farm. Much
more beautiful than The Farm, and with much less to fill a day.</p>

<p>Friday morning I ate a small amount of acid. The idea was to gauge the strength before
sharing. After a few hours I had another quarter plus a full tab, measured by estimating
the typical size of a tab but truthfully just making it up as I divided. I shared what I
later learned was more than anticipated with friends. In retrospect, it was probably more
than anticipated for everyone involved.</p>

<p>After the first couple of hours of coming up as we explored the still-under-construction
festival, we collectively decided that constant movement was going to be necessary.</p>

<p>fast forward</p>

<p>Seeing the rolling hills and the dying corn fields and dilapidated barns and the forests
and springs and honest-to-god meadows and impromptu suburbs of tents and RVs over the
course of the day gave me an incredible sense that I had arrived somewhere I have been
looking for for a very long time. I was overwhelmed with the feeling that I was walking
through a place I would have otherwise thought of as unattainable.</p>
