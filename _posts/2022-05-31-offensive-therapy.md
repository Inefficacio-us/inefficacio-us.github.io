Challenges are tricky things.  

Some - abuse, death of a loved one, illness - are universally agreed upon as
valid. Others - addiction, poverty, *mental* illness - are misunderstood by many
as character flaws. Still others - racial/gender/sexual discrimination - are
denied all together, typically by the same people creating the challenge in the
first place.  

One thing most struggles share is the presence of a voice. Some group of people,
maybe sufferers or survivors of sufferers, who act as a champion and rally
attention to the challenge; who research root causes, scope of impact,
mitigating strategies.  

These are not my challenges.  

My challenges are tangential. They're self inflicted. They'd be welcomed
distractions - luxuries - for many.  

My challenges are survivor's guilt. Imposter syndrome. They're grappling with
how to enjoy my privilege while respecting those with none. They're having
to choose between conflicting events I can afford to attend. They're balancing
my work in my comfortable home with my family who wants my time. They're living
up to my own expectations of myself - impossibly high despite an only
slightly inflated valuation of my own ability.  

They're effects of near-misses and close calls. They're the alternative universe
imagined by those who have struggles worth imagining away. They're the lucky
breaks that differentiate me from the poverty stricken, the addicts, the
incarcerated, the broken.  

My challenges are rooted in proximity to *real* challenges. The inability to
help my brother getting broken on the streets. Lengthening time between calls to
my mother, alone and afraid. Empathizing with loss without the experience to
provide a vocabulary. Offering support to others about difficult decisions I've
never had to make.  

There is no voice for having too many opportunities to choose just one. Or for
the bystanders forced to divorce themselves from the endless perils of others to
save their own mental health. There are no champions rallying for a solution to
the struggle to wake up after late nights spent reading antiquated cryptographic
ciphers and methodologies, or the organization of the Santa Rosa Band of Cahuilla
Indians Tribal Council.  

My challenges are not the plot points that get included in the Cliff Notes. They
don't have a Disney-worthy villain that represents a source and a solution. They
aren't obstacles to overcome.  

My challenges are quirks to be dealt with. They're made up of a series of
choices I knowingly make because their price is one I can afford. Sometimes I
rack up a bill that catches me off guard. I don't have the funds and I have to
work it off. Those occasions are the closest I think I've come to facing a
challenge, but they're rare enough that the time between has provided me a soft
landing.  

My struggle is my reluctance to accept my challenges for what they are; to
accept that struggle is relative and that accepting mine does not devalue
others'. My struggle is in holding myself to the same standards I do others; to
recognize challenges, to practice self care, to put effort into things for no
reason other than easing some burden, no matter how small.  

My challenges are real. Untreated mental illness. Turbulent family. Addictive
tendencies. Unhealthy dependencies. Self-destructive actions.  

My challenges are recursive. To overcome them I must first overcome them.
I have no villain to defeat, no goal marking the threshold between afflicted and
survivor. They are quirks to be dealt with with every decision of every day.
It's exhausting some days. It's business as usual most. On rare occasions, it's
automatic. But they *are* challenges. And refusing to acknowledge them only
makes them inch closer and closer to the type worthy of a voice.
