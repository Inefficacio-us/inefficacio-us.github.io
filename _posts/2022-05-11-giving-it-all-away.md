> The nexus of space and time where you are now is the most immediate sector of
> your universe, and if you're worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or
> somebody else, then you are disempowered, you're giving it all away to icons,
> icons which are maintained by an electronic media so that you want to dress like
> X or have lips like Y. This is shit-brained, this kind of thinking. That is all
> cultural diversion, and what is real is you and your friends and your
> associations, your highs, your orgasms, your hopes, your plans, your fears. And
> we are told 'no', we're unimportant, we're peripheral. 'Get a degree, get a job,
> get a this, get a that.' And then you're a player, you don't want to even play
> in that game. - Terence McKenna
