# Bonnaroo was cancelled
Bonnaroo was cancelled this year. Thirty-six hours before I planned to leave, 36 hours
after I made final travel arrangements.  

None of the rest of the planning matters. Ultimately, I landed on a different farm. Much
more beautiful than The Farm, and with much less to fill a day.  

# Eat acid and stare into the sky
Friday morning I ate a small amount of acid. The idea was to gauge the strength before
sharing. After a few hours I had another quarter plus a full tab, measured by estimating
the typical size of a tab but truthfully just making it up as I divided. I shared what I
later learned was more than anticipated with friends. In retrospect, it was probably more
than anticipated for everyone involved.  

After the first couple of hours of coming up as we explored the still-under-construction
festival, we collectively decided that constant movement was going to be necessary.  

fast forward

Seeing the rolling hills and the dying corn fields and dilapidated barns and the forests
and springs and honest-to-god meadows and impromptu suburbs of tents and RVs over the
course of the day gave me an incredible sense that I had arrived somewhere I have been
looking for for a very long time. I was overwhelmed with the feeling that I was walking
through a place I would have otherwise thought of as unattainable.
