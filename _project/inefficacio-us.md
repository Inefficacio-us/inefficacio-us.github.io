# The Concept
I ingest a lot of information, and I know  that if I do not write about that
information it will never be retained. I sometimes find myself thinking through
a problem with an uncharacteristic clearness, but rarely am able to maintain
that state for long and even more rarely am I able to return to it once
distracted. I encounter resources, text, and art that I want to store and access
on demand.  

I want to commit to *creating* something. I want to learn how to take an idea
and turn it in to a *thing*. I want to create a *shitty* thing and slowly build
it into a *functional* thing that has hope of ultimately becoming a *pretty
good* thing. I want to accept that *pretty good* might be the best I'll ever
do.  

I guess this site is my latest of many attempts to just become a regular-ass
functioning person who can do things.  

# The Method
Honestly, fuck the method. The method is where every past attempt has stopped.
Do it in Jekyll/GitHub Pages or do it in Flask/Azure or do it in PHP/self-hosted, just fucking do it in *something* and keep doing it until you can't imagine *not* doing it.  

Then you can fuck around with methodology.  

# The Content
### The blog:
Stupid shit I think about, as I think about it. Things I find, as I find them.
In-depth dives to particularly noteworthy topics or difficult-to-grasp concepts.  

### The Projects:
Probably just cleaned-up working notes, reference material, design concepts, and
collected resources, with the goal being a project space approximating a
production-quality application documentation site.
